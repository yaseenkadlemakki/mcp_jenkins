# MCP Server Architecture for Jenkins Log Extraction

## Overview
The Master Control Program (MCP) server is designed to extract build logs from Jenkins and transform them into a meaningful XML format. The architecture follows a modular approach to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Components

### 1. Configuration Manager
- Handles configuration loading from config files
- Stores Jenkins connection details (URL, credentials)
- Provides configuration validation
- Supports both demo and production environments

### 2. Authentication Module
- Manages Jenkins authentication
- Handles credential storage and retrieval
- Supports token-based and username/password authentication
- Implements secure credential handling

### 3. Jenkins API Client
- Communicates with Jenkins REST API
- Retrieves build logs from specified jobs
- Handles API errors and retries
- Implements pagination for large log retrieval

### 4. Log Parser
- Processes raw Jenkins build logs
- Extracts meaningful information (timestamps, status, messages)
- Filters logs based on configurable criteria
- Handles different log formats and structures

### 5. XML Transformer
- Converts parsed log data to XML format
- Implements customizable XML schema
- Validates XML against schema
- Handles special characters and encoding

### 6. MCP Core Server
- Orchestrates the workflow between components
- Implements RESTful API endpoints
- Manages error handling and logging
- Provides status monitoring and health checks

### 7. CLI Interface
- Provides command-line interface for operations
- Supports batch processing and scheduling
- Offers configuration management commands
- Implements logging and debugging options

## Data Flow
1. Configuration is loaded from config files
2. Authentication credentials are validated with Jenkins
3. Jenkins API client retrieves build logs
4. Log parser processes and extracts relevant information
5. XML transformer converts parsed data to XML format
6. Output is validated and saved to file or returned via API

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.11 for core implementation
- Flask for RESTful API
- Requests library for Jenkins API communication
- lxml for XML processing
- PyYAML for configuration management
- Click for CLI interface

## Extensibility
The architecture is designed to be extensible in the following ways:
- Support for additional Jenkins log types beyond build logs
- Pluggable authentication mechanisms
- Customizable XML schemas
- Support for alternative output formats (JSON, CSV)
- Integration with monitoring and alerting systems
